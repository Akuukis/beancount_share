        When this transaction is processed:
            2020-01-01 * "BarAlice" "Lunch with friend Bob"
                share: "Bob-4"
                Assets:Cash               -10.00 USD
                Expenses:Food:Drinks

        Then should not error
        Then the original transaction should be modified:
